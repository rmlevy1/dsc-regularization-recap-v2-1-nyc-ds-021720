    "\n",
    "- Regularization discourages overly complex models by penalizing the loss function \n",
    "- Lasso and Ridge are two commonly used so-called regularization techniques \n",
    "- In Ridge regression, the cost function is changed by adding a penalty term to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients \n",
    "- Ridge regression is often also referred to as L2 Norm Regularization \n",
    "- Lasso regression is very similar to Ridge regression, except that the magnitude of the coefficients are not squared in the penalty term \n",
    "- Lasso regression is often also referred to as L1 Norm Regularization \n",
    "- AIC and BIC are two measures which give you a comprehensive measure of model performace taking into account the varying number of features  \n",
    "- The lower the AIC and/or BIC, the better the model "
